## Milestone 4
## Dilara Madinger

As usual, this project showed me how much work it is to make even a simple app. I am happy with the result and I will build on it to make an actual app. However, there are things that I wished I did. These are the items that I will change right after school to try my hand at actually pushing this app to the store.
- I used plist to organize data. Plists are good for smaller, less complex structures. Yet, this is not the best way of handling data, if I think that there will be more data in the future. Realm is the way to go and I will implement that into the app.
- General layout needs to be modified, so that text is more visible. However, since this app is for kids, I would like to put some highlight on the text, so that a child can follow the text while typing directions on the screen.
- Text needs to be reformated, so that the beginning of the sentence is easy to find.
- The most important is the language of the directions. I will need to make sure to simplify it and check with the kids if they like following such directions.
- Color scheme will have to be more interesting.

As a whole, I must say that Apple development is so frustraiting. This is why I want to get more practice in it and be able to develop without fear.
