- Description of your app including your app's inspiration and goal.

The app will be called Native Nations or My Pow Wow, or something like this. This app will have some of the features that are useful for native communities. I would like to show this app to the people from Northern Colorado Intertribal PowWow Association and ask how they would like to improve it and what other apps they could use.

As my family gets more and more involved with the native communities, we notice that people like us need apps to navigate through their various traditions and languages. Native people are always interested in the ways to share their cultures and get more people to come and enjoy Pow Wow's. They would definitely appreciate app projects, as these help young people get interested in their old traditions.

- Define your app's intended audience. Who will be using your app? What problem is your app solving for them?

The intended audience would be anyone interested in native nations' cultures. It will give some insights into philosophies, languages, and show what pow wows are around. Also, we will show it to the leaders of the northern Colorado tribes and get their feedback on what they would like to see.

- Do some research -- do similar apps exist? If so, how will yours be better or different? Research enough to know that what you're proposing is possible.

According to this article <http://www.ogokilearning.com/native-american-apps-provide-huge-returns-tribes/>, mobile apps are very important for various native nations. There are several apps listed there, out of which only one is still live on Android Store. This app was developed by Blackfoot community college students. Even though it looks great, it has only one tab fully implemented, giving recordings of vocabulary. I like the way this app uses tab bar and would like to use the same style in my app.

I will also need to have functionalities to record, play back, recommend Pow Wows. If either of these is not working out in the timeframe that I have, I will reduce the number of features going from four tabs to 3. 


- Where will you get any content needed for your app? This could include text, formulas, whatever your app requires.

For content I will use the materials that our family accumulated, online resources for native nations.
