Overall I am happy with the app: even without any polishing, many tribal members would be happy to see this app and hear that it takes just 2 weeks to make this. Looking for language websites and resources, I also realized that there are a bunch of researchers and hobbyist in the tribal and non-tribal community who are trying to preserve languages and cultures, but they have very low level of technical skills. These are the people that I will definitely email and check how we can work together to make these unique and amazing cultures recorded and promoted.

From a technical standpoint, I am glad to have worked with fragments: they are used so much and indeed they are helpful. The hardest aspects of the app for me were to get going with the fragments and learning how different functions work there, as well as working with the recorded audios. Aside from figuring out permissions, it was tricky to get the recordings from the device. I just started figuring out the logic behind different states of the recording page: recording, stopping, listening, stopping the audio. This is when I realized that I need a state machine for this fragment and this would allow me to remove an extra stopping button. That will literally take me no more than an hour, but the time is up. And the app does work, it is just clunky on the recording page.
