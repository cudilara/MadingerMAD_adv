### Description of your app including your app's inspiration and goal.
As usual, I am making the app for my daughter and the kids of her age (she is 8) to learn Linux basic commands, filesystem, and basic network analysis. The app will be called Linux4Ltls and it will have 3 tabs:
* the way - this tab will help the kids learn basic commands for going around the system, creating files, and downloading tools;
* map - here there will be information on the structure of the filesystem;
* street - in this tab there will be directions on how to analyse the network.

The goal of this app is to introduce Linux OS to an elementary school child.
### Define your app's intended audience. Who will be using your app? What problem is your app solving for them?
My daughter just got her first Raspberry Pi and she is very interested in the terminal and how to use it. Even though there are some programs on Raspbian OS that help with the terminal commands, having an app will make terminal friendlier. Plus, she really likes developing project apps with me and, hopefully, this will add another dimension to pretty dry material.
### Do some research -- do similar apps exist? If so, how will yours be better or different? Research enough to know that what you're proposing is possible.
There are not many apps teaching how to use Linux, and all of them are designed for adults. Unix CLI explains commands simply for an adult, but my daughter could not tell what to do with the "ls" command and why it is useful. Linux Academy has a little bit more in it, but again the format is not for kids. Hacker's Quest is way too complex with the black screen and much of green text. Frankly, these are the only mobile apps that I found. Raspberry Pi itself has great games and apps that teach kids hopw to code and use their Linux. The problem with them is that they can be too overwhelming and complex to manage on one screen with opened terminal. My daughter needs something analogous to adult Linux apps, just a little bit friendlier and inviting.

My app will be different as it won't have much of a dark background if at all and it will have text suggesting what to do with the commands. Of course, it will have to have pictures, most probably of penguins and seals referring to Linux and MariaDB.
### Where will you get any content needed for your app? This could include text, formulas, whatever your app requires.
For the app I will need text, explaining commands and suggesting what to do with them, images, and possibly sounds or music. For the text, I will use open source resources as a basis for my rewording. For the images I will use open source, Russian cartoon, and possibly general searched images with the references to them. If I need music, I will get it from Youtube APIs.
